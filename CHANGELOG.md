# Changelog — oh-my-project (omp)

All notable changes to this harness. Hook contract changes are recorded explicitly
(siblings oms/omd treat the route/verify hook text as a versioned contract).

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-30

Initial implementation. Project-folder management & evolution harness — sibling of
oh-my-scholar (oms) and oh-my-docs (omd), modeled on their verified stage-driven golden.

### Added

- **8 stage skills** (`skills/omp-*/SKILL.md`): init, codify, organize, dataset, doc,
  learn, audit, pilot — a management loop, not a generation pipeline.
- **5 agents** (`agents/*.md`, 11-section `<Agent_Prompt>` XML):
  - `project-scanner` (sonnet, read-only) — inventory + inductive structure/naming scan
  - `rule-architect` (opus, read-only) — preset×scan synthesis, promotion judgment
  - `organizer` (sonnet, write) — the ONLY file-moving agent; obeys safe-fileops.md
  - `dataset-curator` (sonnet, write manifest) — checksum/split/lineage, metadata-only
  - `auditor` (opus, read-only) — rule-compliance PASS/FAIL, detection-only
- **6 preset cards** (`references/presets/`): python-ml, web-app, research-lab,
  monorepo, johnny-decimal, generic — generic seeds for the "ships generic" half.
- **4 reference cards** (`references/`): safe-fileops.md (organizer's hard protocol),
  output-layout.md (.omp/ path SSOT), omc-backport-analysis.md (OMC adopt/exclude),
  learning-protocol.md (the generic→specialized self-evolution SSOT).
- **2 machine schemas** (`references/schemas/`): rules.schema.json (with `specificity`
  0..1 tracking generic→specialized), manifest.schema.json (metadata-only datasets).
- **2 hooks** (`hooks/`, stdlib-only, fail-open, cross-platform):
  - `omp_route_emit.py` (UserPromptSubmit) — injects `STAGE(project) → …` checkpoint
  - `omp_verify_emit.py` (PostToolUse) — integrity reminder after `.omp/` edits or
    move/delete commands. Deliberately avoids the freeze-inducing "fix before
    continuing" phrasing (OMC freeze pattern); reminder tone only, never auto-fixes.

### Hook contract

- `omp_route_emit.py` STAGE catalog = `init|codify|organize|dataset|doc|learn|audit|omp-pilot` (8 stages).
- `omp_verify_emit.py` fires on `Edit|Write|MultiEdit|Bash`; reminds only on `.omp/`
  paths (incl. Windows `\` separators) or move/delete commands; silent otherwise.

### Verification

- `tests/` — 21 passed, 1 skipped (jsonschema optional). Covers: route 8-stage
  enumeration, fail-open, sibling-label distinctness (STAGE(project) ≠ paper/docs/ROUTE),
  no-emoji, stdlib-only; verify .omp/ detection, move detection, silence on unrelated
  work, **no-freeze-phrase**, Windows path, no-auto-fix; schema validity, specificity
  bounds, metadata-only manifest, SHA-256 determinism + pattern match.

### Deployment

- **omha routing: no card** — omp is a 2nd-tier domain handler, exactly like siblings oms/omd
  (omha `cards/` holds only the tier-1 *how-you-work* lanes: omc, superpowers). omp is routed via its
  own `hooks/omp_route_emit.py` (`STAGE(project) → …`) plus its `plugin.json` description landing on
  omha's 2nd-tier domain-skill path. omha core / omc / superpowers cards stay untouched. (Card-tier
  rationale: design §6 re-review correction. The earlier `cards/oh-my-project.json` was removed via trash.)
- **Marketplace registration + git push: done.** The harness is pushed to the GitHub source
  (`luckkim123/oh-my-project`, public) and registered in heroacademia's
  `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` alongside siblings oms/omd, with `oh-my-project@heroacademia`
  enabled in claudebase `config/settings.json` — installable like the other siblings.

### Notes

- **runtime end-to-end not yet measured** — Claude Code does not reload plugins mid-session;
  a fresh session is required to load the skills/hooks and exercise the full loop.
- Identity axis unique to omp (absent in oms/omd): the **generic→specialized** evolution
  — logic stays generic, the per-project `.omp/` diverges (see learning-protocol.md).
